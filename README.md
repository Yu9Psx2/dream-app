The purpose of this site is fourfold:
1. To use an API to access resources such as ChatGPT and stable diffusion.
2. To use AWS to host the application and AWS Lambda to do the backend work.
3. To learn a little bit about front end development
4. To use ChatGPT to do that front end.

The current weaknesses of the project are:
1. Images generated through the dream-studio API are not as good as Midjourney, which does not currently have an API.
2. The story sometimes offers options that are paths of the story and not options for the protagonist.
